# Boatmobile, JS Conf 2019
_Forked from: [Nodeboats-jsconf2018](https://github.com/nodebots/nodeboats-jsconf2018)_

```
> node code/index.js
```

The script attempts to connect to the boat and allows you to control it using the arrow keys in the terminal or using the Joystick web app (served from `/code/app` and accessible at http://localhost).
